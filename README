An appendix to the paper submission 
"Statistical Machine Learning and Dissolved Gas Analysis: A Review" 
that describes the machine learning algorithms with further details, 
is available at: https://piotrmirowski.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/mlreview4dgoa_appendix.pdf


## Requirements:
The following libraries need to be installed 
(and the Matlab paths configured accordingly):
LibSVM with Matlab interface, 
available at: http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/
Low-Density Separation, available at: http://olivier.chapelle.cc/lds/
The Matlab Statistics Toolbox

A copy of the `bolasso` library is available in this repository. 
It was taken from repository:
[github.com/probml/pmtk1](https://github.com/probml/pmtk1/tree/master/pmtk/optim/Lasso) 
by Matthew Dunham and it is an implementation of Francis R. Bach's Bolasso algorithm
described in his [ICML 2008 paper](http://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/icml_bolasso.pdf).


## Installation:
After download, unzip and configure the required paths.


## Tutorial:
In directory Code_Duval, execute under Matlab the following file:
Duval.m
